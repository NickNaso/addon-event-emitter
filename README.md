# Event Emitter on Node.js Native Addons using N-API

## How to create and use **[Event Emitter](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/events.html)** on Node.js Native Addons

// WIP

This is my personal research on the Native Addons and it's all in a working progress status


## This project is under development yet :-) 
### Give me other time i work with :heart: for all of you

Node.js includes an **[event system](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/events.html)**
which is an implementation of the **Observer** pattern that is the most common used
**event** pattern in Node.js application and for good reasons: it's incredibly
simple and useful. 

Anyone who has used Node.js should be familiar with **[events](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/events.html)**.
This module has the responsability to facilitate the communication between **objects**
of your application.

> Much of the Node.js core API modules are built aroud an idiomatic asynchronous
> event-driven architecture in which certains kinds of objects (called **emitter**)
> periodically emit named events that cause Function objects ("listeners") to be called.

Sometimes you need to promote loose coupling system by ensuring that instead of 
components (modules) referring to each other explicitly, their interaction is 
handled through an exchange of message using the **events**. 
This can help to decouple the systems and improve the module reusability.

Here you can find a collection of examples where I used or implemented **event
emitter** interface in a Node.js Native AddOns.

In each example directory, run:

```text
$ npm install
$ node-gyp rebuild
$ node index.js or npm start
```

## Examples

* **[Emit event from C++](/00)**
* **[Implement a Native Addons object that inherit from Event Emitter](/01)**
* **[Emit event from an AsyncWorker](/02)** - Not ready yet 
* **[Transform event emitter to stream](/03)** - Not ready yet
